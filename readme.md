Web Project 3 - Zemira Kehati

## The project talks about the topic "From Portland to Portland -
Epic Bicycle Journey from Portland, ME. To Portland, OR ".
## I created a web page divided into a title, a main section and a footer.
The title contains a logo and a link to the language.

## The main section contains several sections:
* Lead - title, subtitle, image and caption.
* Introduction - title, subtitle, paragraph and list.
* Image network - 12 images with spaces between them, arranged according to GRID.
* Places - 5 places, each of them has a title, a link to another site, a photo and a description. This is also arranged by GRID.
* Cover - link that contains an image and text - title and subtitle.

## The footer contains:
* 3 links
