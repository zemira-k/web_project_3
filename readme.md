## Web Project 3 - Zemira Kehati

## Project Name: From Portland to Portland 
### Epic Bicycle Journey from Portland, ME. To Portland, OR.

## Project description and its functionality: 
* In the header there is a link for language selection. 
* The lead section contains a title, subtitle and an image. 
* An intro article. 
* A grid of 12 images. 
* A section of places, each of them contains a title, a link, a photo and description, arranged by grid. 
* A link cover. 
* And a footer with some useful links and copyright.

## Technologies and techniques used: 
* Some parts are arranged with flex, and others with grid. 
* In html I used tags like - body, main. footer, section, img, a, span, ul, li, h1, h2, p, figure. 
* Each block and element has a class. 
* All classes are arranged in folders and files according to BEM. 
### In css I used - 
* Max-width for page-container. 
* Percentage width for all block classes, so the page will be responsive. 
* Grid for the twelve images. Arranged them with grid-template-column, grid-template-rows and grid gap. 
* Media queries for breaking points. 
* The pseudo class "hover" for all the links.
